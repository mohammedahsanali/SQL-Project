# IPL Auction Data Analysis
Motive
The motive of this project is to develop a robust auction strategy for a new IPL franchise. This involves analyzing past IPL data to create a strong and balanced squad.

# Background
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. It is one of the most-attended cricket leagues globally and has a significant impact on the cricketing world.

# Problem Statement
In the upcoming IPL season, a new team is being added, and a mega auction is being held to build the team's squad. The team's management and auction strategy should consider factors such as budget allocation, team needs, player availability, player form, and player value.

# Data
The dataset provided includes IPL data from the first season to the 13th season (2020). Proper analysis and understanding of the data are necessary before loading it into the SQL server.

# Bidding on Batsmen
Aggressive Batsmen
Aggressive batsmen play a key role in setting the tone for the innings. The goal is to acquire 2-3 players with a high strike rate (S.R) who have faced at least 500 balls.

# Anchor Batsmen
In T20 cricket, consistency is crucial. To achieve this, the objective is to get 2-3 players with a good average who have played more than 2 IPL seasons.

# Hard Hitters
Hard-hitting batsmen are essential for quick scoring. The aim is to acquire 2-3 hard-hitting players who have scored the most runs in boundaries and have played more than 2 IPL seasons.

# Bidding on Bowlers
Economical Bowlers
Economical bowlers help control the run rate and apply pressure. The goal is to get 2-3 bowlers with a good economy who have bowled at least 500 balls in the IPL.

# Wicket-Taking Bowlers
Wicket-taking bowlers have the ability to break partnerships and create pressure. The objective is to get 2-3 bowlers with the best strike rate who have bowled at least 500 balls in the IPL.

# All-Rounders
All-rounders contribute with both bat and ball, providing versatility to the team. The focus is on acquiring 2-3 all-rounders with the best batting and bowling strike rates, having faced at least 500 balls and bowled a minimum of 300 balls.

# Wicketkeeper
A wicketkeeper's role is crucial in T20 cricket. Criteria for selecting the best wicketkeepers include their batting and wicketkeeping abilities.

# Visual Representation
A visual representation, including graphs, tables, and charts, will be created to present the list of players to the team management before the auction.

# Evaluation
The evaluation will be based on the accuracy of the solutions provided for batters, bowlers, all-rounders, wicketkeepers, additional questions, and visualizations. Each section has specific marking criteria, and the total marks will be calculated accordingly.
